CHANGELOG:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Version 1.0 - 3 April 2008 - Brian Stanback
    * Initial release

- Version 2.0 - 27 Feb 2010 - Thom Dyson
    * Changed the UPS processing to match the current UPS format
    * Added Support for day of the week to the date

- Version 2.1 - 3 March 2010 - Thom Dyson
    * Changed the UPS detail processing to handle blank locations by repeating
      the previous value
    * Added an "as of" line so that the age of the data can be seen
    * Changed the FedEx format to handle the current layout
    * Removed Google Maps Geocode function

- Version 3.0 - 27 July 2010 - Brian Stanback
    * Decoupled cache handling from main tracking class to allow
      developers to decide if and how caching is implemented.
    * Setup abstract class for which each carrier extends. (While this increases
      lines of code and number of files, it improves modularity and does a
      better job at self-documenting which should facilitate maintainability
      and make API integration easier.)
    * Cleaned up formatting of code and added more comments (should
      now be able to run through phpDocumentor with a bit of finessing).
    * Updated the UPS carrier class to match the current UPS format.
    * Updated FedEx carrier class to be much simpler and more robust by
      leveraging json_decode().
    * Tested with live and historical UPS and FedEx tracking numbers, and 
      historical USPS numbers. All other carriers are untested. Please direct
      any issues or patches to the Chumby forum topic at 
      <http://forum.chumby.com/viewtopic.php?id=2079&p=2>.
    * Added check-bit and syntax detection for carriers to allow auto-detection
      of carrier based on the number specified.
    * Included German DHL community contribution.
